## Stakeholder Meeting

The Aerie project manager is responsible for scheduling and executing monthly stakeholder meetings with the community. This meeting will be open to the public and will focus on providing project status, key announcements and updates, and changes to project plans including changes to the roadmap and deliveries. In addition, short demos of new or upcoming capabilities may take place for stakeholders to get a "first look" and provide feedback. Meetings will be recorded and notes will be taken for posterity.

### Updating Meeting Invite

- Aerie project events are managed via a public Google Calendar. Anyone can search for and subscribe to the calendar. Accessing the calendar is as easy as clicking on [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y180OTYxMmZjZmM5Yjg0NzMzODI2ODhhYTY1ZjE2MDkxYzM2OWQzYzVjNGJmZDlmMTQ0ZjMxZThmNzk3ZmRmMmFmQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)
- Currently meetings are the second Wednesday of every month at 2pm PT. 
- For stakeholder meetings, ensure that aerie-users@googlegroups.com is added as a guest. 
- Ensure that a virtual meeting link is included as the meeting “location”. Currently, the project uses Microsoft Teams for their virtual meetings as this is the preferred tool within the project manager’s affiliated organization, but any virtual meeting software that can provide a public link is acceptable. 

### Meeting Preparation

- Add issue in [PMC repo](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-pmc/) with agenda and links to virtual meeting/notes. Add a "meeting" label to distinguish from other issue types
- Build presentation material if required
- Ensure presentation material has been approved for release by project manager’s affiliated organization

### Meeting Execution

- Assign note taker prior to the meeting to capture high level comments from stakeholders and/or actions
- Don't forget to record the meeting! 
- Monitor meeting discussion to ensure it is kept to the information contained in the agenda/presentation material and does not stray into business or export sensitive topics.

### Post-Meeting

- Post presentation material to [Aerie PMC Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0ALCWXMVW95k9Uk9PVA)
- Have note taker submit a PR for notes on GitHub
- Update links in issue if necessary and close out issue


## Google Groups Management

There are currently three groups to manage:
- Aerie Users, aerie-users@googlegroups.com
- Aerie Support, aerie-support@googlegroups.com 
- Aerie PMC, aerie-pmc@googlegroups.com 

Aerie Users is open to the public and users should be able to add/remove themselves at will. If a new member is interested in joining groups, the easiest way to do so is to go to https://groups.google.com/g/aerie-users and select “Ask to Join”. Members of the PMC/TSC should be managers of this group so that they can approve new members. 

Aerie Support should consist of the project manager, members of the TSC, and any other collaborators who the TSC believes can assist with providing community support. 

The Aerie PMC should only consist of members of the PMC.
